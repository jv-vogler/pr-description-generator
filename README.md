# [PR Description Generator](https://pr-description-generator.vercel.app/)
The goal of this app is to provide a template for creating good PR descriptions.

## [Live page](https://pr-description-generator.vercel.app/)

# How to use
1. Edit the fields as you like.
2. Click the copy to clipboard button when you're satisfied.
3. Paste it on your Pull Request description.

Tip: You can ommit a field without deleting it by erasing its `Title`. 

Let's say you don't have any `Notes` on your specific PR, then you can just erase that field title.
